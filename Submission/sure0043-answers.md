**Question 1a: What does this do?**

ls -l > lab2-1.txt

By doing this code in terminal a .txt file named lab2-1.txt was created.



**Make a copy of the file lab2-1.txt and call it lab2-2.txt**

**Question 1b: What command did you use?**

The command I used to copy and create renamed file is 

“cp lab1-2.txt lab2-2.txt”

 

**Using Nano, change one of the lines of lab2-2.txt then save the file.** 

**Move the file lab2-1.txt to the folder cst8254/linux/labs/Lab2**

**Question 1c: What command did you use?**

I used nano <filename.txt> command to rewrite the file.

nano lab2-2.txt

Then the file will open in terminal, and we are able to rewrite the file. After rewriting we need to do ‘^o’ to write to the file and ‘^x’ to exit.

To move the file from one directory to another I used a command called “mv”.

mv lab2-1.txt ~/cst8254/linux/labs/Lab2



**Using Nano, create the file <networkid>.txt in the cst8254 folder where <networkid> is your Algonquin network ID. As for the content of the file, write a simple one liner on one thing you learned about Linux this semester.**

**Once you have saved and exited from Nano, issue the following command:**

**tree cst8254 > lab2-3.txt** 

Created a file in the name of sure0043 and saved it in the directory cst8254.

“nano sure0043.txt”

This will create a file in the directory with the. Comments I entered.
